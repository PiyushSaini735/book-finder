    <h4> 5. "Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions" by Edwin A. Abbott</h4>
    <h>Summary:  "Do not all charms fly at the mere touch of cold philosophy?"
    "Flatland" is a unique mathematical novella written by Edwin A. Abbott in 1884. It explores the concept of higher
    dimensions through the perspective of a two-dimensional world inhabited by geometric shapes.
    Discussion: How does "Flatland" challenge our perception of reality and dimensions, and what relevance does it hold
    in modern mathematics?</h>
    <br>

    <h4> 6. "Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid" by Douglas Hofstadter</h4>
    <h>Summary: "The 'strange loop' phenomenon occurs whenever, by moving upwards (or downwards) through the levels of some
    hierarchical system, we unexpectedly find ourselves right back where we started."
    Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer Prize-winning book, "Gödel, Escher, Bach," intertwines mathematics, art, and music in
    an exploration of self-reference and the nature of intelligence.
    Discussion: How does "Gödel, Escher, Bach" encourage interdisciplinary thinking and its impact on creativity and
    problem-solving?</h>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <h4> 7. "A Mathematician's Apology" by G. H. Hardy</h4>
    <h>Summary: "A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns."
    G. H. Hardy's "A Mathematician's Apology" is a reflection on the aesthetics of mathematics and the role of pure
    mathematics in the scientific world.
    Discussion: How does Hardy's perspective on the beauty of mathematics in "A Mathematician's Apology" influence our
    appreciation of abstract mathematical concepts?</h>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <h4> 8. "The Man Who Knew Infinity: A Life of the Genius Ramanujan" by Robert Kanigel</h4>
    <h>Summary: "An equation means nothing to me unless it expresses a thought of God."
    "The Man Who Knew Infinity" tells the inspiring story of the self-taught Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan
    and his groundbreaking contributions to number theory.
    Discussion: How does Ramanujan's life and work, as depicted in "The Man Who Knew Infinity," inspire future
    generations of mathematicians?</h>
