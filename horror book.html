    <h1>Top 10 Horror Books.</h1>
    <br>
    <h4>1. Red Dragon by Thomas Harris</h4>
    <h> Summary:The Silence of the Lambs gets all the attention, but the best Hannibal Lecter novel is still the first;
        a book that suggests the most horrifying of evils can grow from an all too human place, and that even heroes can
        carry something monstrous inside them. Every Lecter story on some level features an implicit Faustian bargain
        and none is more tragic than FBI crimimal profiler Will Graham’s knowing choice to sacrifice his own fragile
        peace of mind to stop a killer he understands all too well.</h>

        <h4>2. The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde</h4>
        <h> Summary:There are no real villains in Oscar Wilde’s first and only novel. The lurking danger of this book is
            our
            capacity for vanity and how it can literally and metaphorically disfigure us, how obsession with retaining
            beauty will inevitably lead to its destruction. Even Wilde’s central monster, Dorian himself, is more tragic
            idiot than conniving mastermind, a youthful dope consumed by a pathological belief that the only thing worth
            having is beauty at any cost. His descent would almost be funny if it wasn’t so chillingly believable.</h>

    <div>
        <h4> 3. Horns by Joe Hill</h4>
        <h> Summary:Sometimes horror, even at its darkest, is the window dressing for something more tender. That’s the
            case
            with the unique and entirely enrapturing Horns, a book that starts out as a twisted revenge story before
            slowly
            becoming something more sprawling, knotty, and ultimately hopeful. Horns is by turns a gothic romance, a
            murder
            mystery, a supernatural thriller and a biting satire on how quick we can be to judge despite the darkness we
            all
            harbour.</h>
        <br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h4>4. The Exorcist by William Peter Blatty</h4>
        <h> Summary:Often the best horror stories are the ones that believe, through all the death, jump-scares and
            creepiness, in the fundamental triumph of goodness. That The Exorcist was long considered one of the most
            terrifying novels ever is in large part is down to how deeply we are led to care about the desperate plight
            of
            its central characters, and how carefully detailed every one of them is. The evil they face is huge and
            incomprehensible, but not, in the end, insurmountable, and much of the book’s (and film’s) power comes from
            the
            ultimate hard-won victory of a small group who sacrifice everything for an innocent child.</h>

        <h4>5. Ring by Koji Suzuki, translated by Robert B Rohmer and Glynne Walley</h4>
        <h> Summary:Successive film adaptations have not managed to capture the true power of this relatively demure
            tale of
            a cursed videotape, a chilling and all too human story of coming to understand your own insignificance in
            the
            face of forces beyond your comprehension. While Ring is a classic, it’s in its two sequels that Suzuki
            revealed
            the scope of his ambition, organically building on his horror fable to craft something far more epic and
            transcendent than any filmed version has yet realised.</h>
        <br>

    <br>
    <div>
        <h4>6. Psycho by Robert Bloch</h4>
        <h> Summary:To be clear, like Jaws, the film is better; Hitchcock having made a series of clever tweaks to find
            new
            ways of manipulating the audience by making them care. But everything that turned Psycho into an enduring
            cultural lightning rod originated in Bloch’s novel; the shower scene, the house on the hill, the twist
            ending
            and the sense of gothic dread dripping from every moment. The gleeful subversion of conventions that
            Hitchcock
            gets all the credit for originated here, and without this book, horror – and cinema – wouldn’t be the same.
        </h>

        <h4> 7. The Passage by Justin Cronin</h4>
        <h> Summary:Justin Cronin’s epic vampire saga is a sprawling tale of love, loss and societies destroyed, rebuilt
            and
            destroyed again, centred not only on characters we could care deeply for, but a slowly growing sense of
            insidious evil whispering from the shadows, a terror so unknowable that it was always going to lose a little
            menace once it was explained. But like the best horror writers, Cronin uses that inevitability to make his
            point
            – that all too often evil grows from a place that is a little more understandable than we might care to
            confront. The whole trilogy is fantastic, but for its singular atmosphere of growing dread the first will
            always
            be the best.</h>
        <br>

    <div>
        <h4>8. Misery by Stephen King</h4>
        <h>Summary: There’s an intoxicating combination of anger, sadness and catharsis at the heart of Misery; a book
            written by an
            author trying to move away from horror only to find that his vast readership wouldn’t accept that. Cue the
            story
            of a writer literally held hostage by a fan torturing him into writing what she wants, facilitating the
            writer’s
            slow realisation that the genre he was so desperate to move on from may be the only one that’s right for
            him.
            It’s an intensely personal and ambivalent book, and one of the best explorations of the highs and lows of
            creativity ever written.</h>
        <br>

        <h4>9. From Hell by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell</h4>
        <h>Summary: I don’t know whether it’s cheating to include a graphic novel on this list, but this is a horror
            masterpiece
            unlike anything else I’ve ever read, a sprawling, phonebook-heavy exploration of not just the Jack the
            Ripper
            murders, but the society that allowed them to happen. Unflinching and harsh, grim and deliberate, the book
            is an
            almost forensic dissection of Victorian England, suggesting that the motives for the murders, caused by a
            collision of dogma, classism and puritanical propriety, were the inevitable result of the true human horrors
            that made up a seemingly polite society.</h>
        <br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h4>10. In the Woods by Tana French</h4>
        <h>Summary: I know; this is not horror, at least not insofar as where it sits in bookstores. But I would also
            argue it’s
            not a traditional crime novel or literary character study either. In the Woods uses the structure of a
            whodunnit to craft one of the most haunting explorations of fear I’ve ever read and, in doing so, includes
            the only written scene to ever make me jump, a scene so infused with the force of an unshakable nightmare
            that it transforms the book around it, leaving readers with the sense that some evils can never be truly
            understood and some trauma is too great to move on from. If that doesn’t encapsulate horror at its most
            evocative, I have no idea what does.</h>
