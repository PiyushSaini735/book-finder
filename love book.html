    <h1>Top 10 Love Books</h1>
    <br>
    <h4>1. It Ends with Us Boxed Set by Colleen Hoover (2023)</h4>
    <h>Summary: Grab the box set so you won't have to frantically order the second installment of this smash hit from
        Colleen
        Hoover. If you haven't read her books yet, start with these two and then work your way through the back catalog.
        In them, you'll meet Lily, a woman who finds herself in a bit of a love triangle as she grapples with her new
        relationship with Ryle, and re-meeting her ex lover, Atlas. It contains a lot of heartbreak, as domestic
        violence is a critical part of Lily's story, but it's also extremely touching.</h>

            certain mouse-centric theme park. Lauren is a serious bookkeeper at a theme park where it's always winter,
            which

            trying
            to spice things up around the office. Of course, their boss asks them to team up on a project. And
            naturally,
            sparks fly. Read to find out the rest.</h>

            spar on both professional and personal fronts are definitely not homework. Did somebody leave a bunsen
            burner on, or are things heating up in here?</h>

        <h4>4. Witch of Wild Things by Raquel Vasquez Gilliland (2023)</h4>
        <h>Summary: Sage Flores has been running from her ability to commune with plants ever since her sister passed
            away. But after she's forced to return to her hometown and slips back into her old life — including
            reconnecting with a high school flame who broke her heart — she can't deny her gift or her family any
            longer. You could cut the tension here with a knife, or should we say, a pair of gardening shears.</h>

    <div>
        <h4>5.Long Shot by Kennedy Ryan (2023)</h4>
        <h>Summary:Sports fans know how emotional a high-stakes game can get. Add actual romance into the mix, and all
            we can say is just remember to hydrate. This heartstring-tugger is all about missed connections, tarnished
            golden boys and the darkness that can lie beneath the most glittering exteriors.</h>

            rough-and-tumble handyman Red. But what she finds is more than meets the eye, in this first in an absolutely
            devour-able series.</h>

        <h>Summary:If you've never read Anaïs Nin and call yourself a romance fan, fix that right now. This vintage
            short story collection's erotic vibes still hold up. But don't take our word for it — turn off the lights,
            slip into something slinky and try it for yourself.</h>
