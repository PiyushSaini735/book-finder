    <h1>Top 10 Motivational Books</h1>
    <br>
    <h4>1. The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</h4>
    <h>Summary:While he gets a bit preachy sometimes, Stephen Covey's road map for living doesn't just help you develop better
    habits. It also convinces you that acquiring them will make you a better person.</h>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <h> Best quote: "Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, reap a habit; sow a habit, reap a character; sow a
    character, reap a destiny."</h>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <h4>2. How to Win Friends & Influence People</h4>
    <h>Summary: Prior to Dale Carnegie's classic, mixing business relationships with personal relationships was considered a bit
    underhanded, like nepotism. After Carnegie, business relationships and personal relationships were seen not just as
    compatible, but as absolutely inseparable.</h>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <h> Best quote: "The unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some
    way, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize their importance,
    and recognize it sincerely."</h>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <h4> 3. Think and Grow Rich</h4>
    <h>Summary: Napoleon Hill interviewed "40 millionaires" to discover the common thought processes and behaviors that had led to
    their success. His study of these "best practices" was revolutionary in a world where it was largely assumed that
    great wealth resulted from a combination of greed and luck.</h>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <h> Best quote: "All the breaks you need in life wait within your imagination. Imagination is the workshop of your mind,
    capable of turning mind energy into accomplishment and wealth."</h>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>

    <h4> 4. Awaken the Giant Within</h4>
    <h>Summary: Anthony Robbins is unlike most motivational writers in two ways. First, he treats training the mind and body as a
    technological challenge rather than moral imperative. Second, he somehow manages to be both an inspirational role
    model and the most annoying guy on the planet.</h>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <h> Best quote: "If you can't, you must. If you must, you can."</h>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <h4> 5. As a Man Thinketh</h4>
    <h>Summary: Motivational books are usually about taking immediate action. By contrast, this 1902 classic by James Allen is a bit
    more, well, thoughtful. It explains how your thoughts mold your personality, and how that personality drives you to
    take action and determines the type of action you'll take.</h>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <h> Best quote: "The dreamers are the saviors of the world. As the visible world is sustained by the invisible, so men,
    through all their trials and sins and sordid vocations, are nourished by the beautiful visions of their solitary
    dreamers."</h>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <h4> 6. The Greatest Salesman in the World</h4>
    <h>Summary: Far more than just a sales book, Og Mandino's faux-biblical parable encourages you to live your life to the fullest
    by believing in yourself and your ability to help others. Required reading for anybody who sells. Which is just
    about everybody.</h>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <h> Best quote: "I will live this day as if it is my last. This day is all I have and these hours are now my eternity. I
    greet this sunrise with cries of joy as a prisoner who is reprieved from death. I lift mine arms with thanks for
    this priceless gift of a new day."</h>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <h4> 7. Don't Sweat the Small Stuff</h4>
    <h>Summary: A big part of motivation is clearing your mind of the clutter that weighs it down. Richard Carlson helps you
    differentiate between what's really important--and deserving of your attention--and what's just "noise in the
    system."</h>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <h> Best quote: "Stress is nothing more than a socially acceptable form of mental illness."</h>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <h4> 8. Drive</h4>
    <h>Summary: Motivation comes from the judicious use of carrots and sticks, right? Not so, says author Daniel Pink. His book
    illustrates the fact that motivation comes from many sources and that, at the highest level of performance,
    motivation come from your deepest and most profound sense of who you are and want to be.</h>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <h> Best quote: "For artists, scientists, inventors, schoolchildren, and the rest of us, intrinsic motivation--the drive
    to do something because it is interesting, challenging, and absorbing--is essential for high levels of creativity."</h>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <h4> 9. The Power of Positive Thinking</h4>
    <h>Summary: When it was first published, both psychologists and theologians attacked this book as heretical, and accused author
    Norman Vincent Peale of being a crank. Today, science has verified the book's basic concept--that being optimistic
    makes you healthier and happier and thus more likely to succeed.</h>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <h> Best quote: "Action is a great restorer and builder of confidence. Inaction is not only the result, but the cause,
    of fear. Perhaps the action you take will be successful; perhaps different action or adjustments will have to
    follow. But any action is better than no action at all."</h>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <h4> 10. Man’s Search for Meaning</h4>
    <h>Summary: Imagine that you have been imprisoned for a very long time. The guards have taken away everything – food, clothing,
    friends, family, and a life worth living. During that moment, what could you possibly think? Can you think of a
    possibility? Viktor Frankl did. He thought to himself – What if they take away everything and still can’t get to the
    deeper part of me where I am my own? And he did. He came out alive from that Nazi camp and wrote this book. If you
    are prone to despair, this is a must-read book.</h>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <h> Best quote: "Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one's
    attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.”</h>
